Hello, I'm João and I'm a software engineer that also likes to read, write and take pictures while traveling.
I'm a believer in life long learning and that people should be able to do what they love in their lives. Coincidentally I also believe we should love more than one thing and do more than one thing during our lives.

I'm an avid reader of non fiction in the intersection of the technology, psychology and business fields along with science fiction and fantasy which give me room to escape from the real world and renew my imagination and creativity.
